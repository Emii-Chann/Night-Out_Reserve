# Install application
To install and try out the application, download this folder and open the `_RUN.sh` file. If you have Docker on your computer, the application will start automatically.

## Notes:
- to modify the installation change the docker-compose
- if you want to test the app with any data, you can change the datafactory by add or remove any `.sql` file from folder `sql-scripts`.
- **!important:** every table, database and mysql procedure need to be in the folder `sql-scripts` in `.sql` format.
